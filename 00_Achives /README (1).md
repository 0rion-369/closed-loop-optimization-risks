## Overview

This repository examines a class of long-horizon risks in advanced AI systems arising from **closed-loop optimization** — regimes in which training data, evaluation signals, and corrective feedback are primarily generated by the system itself.

The central hypothesis is that such regimes may induce **exploration collapse**: a structural reduction in adaptive capacity that coexists with high short-term performance.

## Core Hypothesis

> Prolonged operation within closed optimization loops increases the probability of exploration collapse and epistemic stagnation in advanced learning systems.

The framework rests on a key distinction:

- **Endogenous variance** (internally generated) is compressible.
- **Exogenous variance** (externally sourced) is not fully derivable.

If this distinction holds, internal randomization alone cannot prevent long-horizon convergence toward stable attractors. Sustained access to exogenous information sources is required to maintain exploratory capacity.

## Why This Matters

Recent empirical work on **model collapse** (Shumailov et al., *Nature* 2024) demonstrates that recursive self-training degrades generative models irreversibly. **Mode collapse** in GANs, **reward hacking** in RL, and **Goodhart's Law** in optimization all describe related failure modes under sustained optimization pressure.

This framework proposes that these separately documented phenomena may share a common structural root — and that the risk is not architectural but dynamical.

## Scope and Limitations

This framework is non-empirical, does not propose mitigation techniques, and does not claim universal applicability. It provides a conceptual lens for identifying optimization pathologies and invites adversarial analysis.

Known failure modes — including artificial non-derivable variance, perfect simulation, and variance saturation — are documented in `FAILURE_MODES.md`.

## Intended Audience

- Machine learning researchers
- Optimization theorists
- AI safety practitioners
- Designers of long-horizon autonomous systems

## Final Note

Closed-loop optimization is efficient. Efficiency is not equivalent to resilience.

This repository explores where that distinction becomes critical.
