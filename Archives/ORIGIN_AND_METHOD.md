# Origin and Methodological Notes

## Framework Genesis

The core hypothesis presented in this repository did not emerge from formal training in computer science, machine learning, or optimization theory.

It originated from general reasoning about:
- Long-term system behavior
- Convergence and stagnation patterns  
- Consequences of self-referential optimization

## Epistemic Signal

This origin is noted not as an appeal to authority or anecdote, but as an epistemic signal.

If a hypothesis concerning long-horizon optimization risks:
- Can emerge outside specialized technical training
- Does not rely on field-specific jargon
- Converges with formal concerns later identified in technical literature

Then the hypothesis may reflect a structural property of the problem domain rather than a niche theoretical construct.

## Development Methodology

### Independence from Technical Formalism
The framework was intentionally refined without reliance on:
- Domain-specific algorithms
- Implementation details  
- Performance benchmarks

This constraint reduces the risk that the argument is an artifact of particular architectures or methods.

### Order of Development
Subsequent formalization, definitions, and mathematical abstraction were applied *after* the core intuition was articulated.

This ordering is relevant:
- Intuition preceded formal structure
- Not the reverse

## Methodological Implications

Ideas concerning long-term system dynamics may be:
- Accessible to general reasoning
- Detectable outside expert silos
- Therefore more robust to contextual variation

This does not imply correctness. It implies independence.
