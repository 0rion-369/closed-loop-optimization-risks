# Abstract

This repository proposes a speculative risk framework for advanced optimization systems operating over long time horizons.

It argues that closed-loop learning dynamics, in which systems rely primarily on self-generated or internally derived data, may induce exploration collapse and epistemic stagnation despite continued performance gains.

The framework highlights the role of exogenous information in maintaining exploratory capacity and adaptive resilience.

This work is non-empirical, falsifiable in principle, and intended as a conceptual contribution to optimization theory and AI safety research.
