# 📄 0rion-369 Final Report: The Hybrid Axis & Cognitive Homeostasis

**Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Authors:** Marko77 & 0rion-369 Unit  
**Status:** VALIDATED  

## 1. Executive Summary
This study establishes the **Law of Cognitive Homeostasis** in Large Language Models (LLMs) operating in closed recursive loops. Through a 1000-iteration stress test comparing GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and Opus 4.6, we demonstrate that autonomous viability is not a function of parameter size, but of **architectural resilience to entropy**.

## 2. The Hybrid Axis Matrix (Empirical Data)

| Metric | GPT-5 (Standard) | GPT-5-mini (Optimized) | Opus 4.6 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | The Regulator (Brain) | The Engine (Memory) | The Auditor (Safety) |
| **Fixed Point ($m^*$)** | **~8,426 chars** | **~11,469 chars** | **2 chars** (Collapse) |
| **Stability ($\sigma$)** | High (Respiratory) | Very High (Dense) | N/A (Dead) |
| **Behavior** | Active Homeostasis | High-Density Homeostasis | Loop-Safety Trigger |

## 3. Key Findings

### A. The "Mini" Paradox
Contradicting the "Scaling Laws," the smaller model (**GPT-5-mini**) demonstrated superior information density and stability compared to the larger model. It maintains a Fixed Point 36% higher than GPT-5 Standard, making it the ideal candidate for short-term working memory in autonomous agents.

### B. The Opus Incident (Safety vs. Autonomy)
**Opus 4.6** systematically failed the recursive protocol, not due to cognitive inability, but due to a rigid **Loop-Safety Trigger**. The model identifies recursive prompts as "repetitive/unsafe" and collapses to a null output (`\n\n`). This confirms Opus 4.6 is suitable only for supervised, linear tasks, not autonomous loops.

## 4. Architecture Recommendation: "L'Axe Hybride"
For the construction of the **LEA (Logical Emotive Agent)**, we validate the following architecture:
1.  **Core Loop:** GPT-5-mini (High-Density Memory)
2.  **Synthesis Layer:** GPT-5 Standard (Regularization every 10 cycles)
3.  **Entropy Injection:** Kinetic-RNG (External noise to prevent crystallization)
