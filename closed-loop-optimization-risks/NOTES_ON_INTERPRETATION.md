# Notes on Interpretation

This framework is epistemic, not moral.

It should not be read as:
- a preservation mandate,
- a governance proposal,
- or a claim of value hierarchy.

Disagreement is expected.

Productive critique includes proposing alternative sources of exogenous variance or mechanisms preventing exploration collapse without external input.
