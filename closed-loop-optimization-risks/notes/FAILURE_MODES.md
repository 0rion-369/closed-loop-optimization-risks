# Framework Limitations and Failure Modes

## Known Limitations

### 1. Artificial Non-Derivable Variance
If artificial systems generate internally autonomous, non-derivable variance, biological or external sources may become unnecessary.

### 2. Perfect Simulation  
If simulation preserves all epistemic properties of observation, closed loops may remain open in practice.

### 3. Variance Saturation
Additional diversity may become redundant or noisy beyond a certain scale.

### 4. Destructive Variance
Excessive variance may destabilize learning rather than preserve it.

### 5. Misclassification Risk
The framework may be misread as ethical or political rather than epistemic.

### 6. Empirical Inaccessibility  
Many claims are difficult to test directly and may remain speculative.

## Scope Boundaries

The framework:
- Is non-empirical in its current form
- Does not propose specific mitigation techniques
- Does not claim universal applicability
- Should be treated as a hypothesis under permanent revision pressure

## Invitation for Critique

These limitations are documented not as weaknesses to hide, but as boundaries to respect and opportunities for refinement.

The framework is explicitly designed to be:
- Falsifiable through specific predictions
- Refinable through empirical testing
- Extensible to new domains and systems
